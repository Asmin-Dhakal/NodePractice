            <P id=para> Physical fitness is a state of health and well being and,
            more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations
            and daily activities. Physical fitness id generally achieved through proper
            nutrition, moderate- vigorous physical excercise, and sufficient rest along 
            with a formal recovery plan. <br> Arnold's dream was to become the world's greatest 
            bodybuilder, which meant Mr Olympia. He won the title of Mr Olympia in 1970 at the 
            age of 23. He is the youngest man to win Mr Olympia, a record he still holds to this 
            day. He won total 7 Mr Olympia titles.
